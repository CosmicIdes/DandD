This project is a Dungeons and Dragons Character sheet. The character sheet has dropdowns to fill in information such as Character Alignment, Race, and Class. There are also spaces to enter numbers for different stats.

There are media queries and flexbox used to give the page a responsive design.

The GitHub page for this project is located here: https://github.com/OrenjiId3s/DandD

The features used are:

1. Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app: The dropdown menus for Alignment, Race, and Class pull from JSON files.

2. Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX): The dropdown menu for the Spells List and the Background List are from the D&D 5th Edition API. Note: Acolyte is currently the only background available in the Background List API.

3. Create an array, dictionary or list, populate it with multiple values, retrieve at least one value, and use or display it in your application: I created the JSON lists for Alignment, Race, and Class.
