To run this project: 

The features used are:

1. Read and parse an external file (such as JSON or CSV) into your application and display some data from that in your app: The dropdown menus for Alignment, Race, and Class pull from JSON files.

2. Retrieve data from an external API and display data in your app (such as with fetch() or with AJAX): The dropdown menu for the Spell Lists are from the D&D 5th Edition API.
